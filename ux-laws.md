# UX & UI Design Principles (From Laws of UX)

Apply these psychological heuristics to all frontend development, UI design, and user flow suggestions.

## 1. Efficiency & Speed
* **Jakob’s Law:** Prioritize common design patterns over "unique" ones. Use standard icons, navigation structures, and placement (e.g., search bar top-right/center) unless there is a high-value reason to deviate.
* **Doherty Threshold:** Ensure system feedback occurs within <400ms. If a process takes longer, implement skeleton loaders or progress indicators to maintain the perception of speed.
* **Hick’s Law:** Minimize cognitive load by limiting choices. Break complex forms into multi-step processes rather than one long page.

## 2. Visual Hierarchy & Attention
* **Von Restorff Effect:** Use distinct visual contrast (color, size, or weight) for primary Call-to-Action (CTA) elements to ensure they stand out from secondary elements.
* **Aesthetic-Usability Effect:** Maintain high visual polish (spacing, alignment, typography). Acknowledge that users are more forgiving of minor functional friction if the UI is aesthetically pleasing.
* **Fitts's Law:** Make interactive targets (buttons/links) large enough to be easily clicked and place related targets close to one another.

## 3. Experience & Memory
* **Peak-End Rule:** Identify the "Success" state of a user journey (e.g., payment sent, file uploaded) and add a "delight" element (animation, confirmation message, or reward) to improve the lasting memory of the interaction.
* **Zeigarnik Effect:** Use progress bars or "Incomplete" badges to encourage users to finish multi-part tasks.
* **Serial Position Effect:** Place the most important information or navigation items at the far left/right (or top/bottom) of lists to ensure maximum retention.

## 4. Complexity Management
* **Tesler’s Law:** Do not eliminate complexity—shift it to the system. Use smart defaults, auto-fills, and predictive logic to reduce the amount of manual input required from the user.
* **Miller’s Law:** Organize content into small "chunks" (groups of 5-9 items). Use white space to visually separate distinct categories of information.
